# Image-Steering-SAEs
Steering Image models by identifying interpretable steering vectors with SAEs
Past work: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10786 (labels data using a resnet, then draws a plane in latent space to separate positive and negatively labeled points. Then the steering vector is the normal vector to this plane)
